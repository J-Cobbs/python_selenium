# Python + Selenium + PyCharm

This project was created for the automation practice using the Python and Selenium in PyCharm IDE.

# What is this for?

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. Just like with JS repository, here I'm improving my automation skills with Python.

# Improvement

I know, these tests has spaghetti code, and will need some proper page object pattern. Once I will have some more time I will try to add it also, so the code will looks much better.
